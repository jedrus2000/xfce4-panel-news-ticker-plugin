bug list
--------

- regression bug in tickr_feedpicker.c/check_and_update_feed_url():
  some URLs now unreachable (https://politepol.com/fd/Tkny399wXUs5)

- optimize processing time of 'big' text files

- some setting changes not detected, nor re-computed
  -> clock width changes with not-padded hours from 9 to 10 and 12 to 1

- use "\(aq" instead of "\'" at beginning of lines in man page ?

- fix win64 compile stack (or only produce 32-bit binaries ?)

(not a bug)
- -win_x not working BUT seems to actually relate to window manager:
  win_x > 0 is only effective when win_w < screen_w (ie the window can
  only be located 'within' the screen)


stuff to implement and new features requests
--------------------------------------------

- appimage pkg ?

- continue to better document/comment tickr_http.c/fetch_resource()

- update original tickr-url-list:
  - switch to https when doable
  - pick good sources

- in tickr_opml.c:
  - add option to import feed list without checking all URLs ?

- run socket code in a separate thread (asynchronously) ? or use
  g_timeout_add() and g_idle_add() when loading a feed, to avoid gui
  blocking ?

- implement dual licensing: paid licenses for commercial use or extended
  support ????

- make end-of-feed-blank-line a setting (alternative = str)

- should 'overrideredirect' option be set only from CLI ?

- read from stdin -> -text="" ?
  -> echo "hello" > msg_file && tickr msg_file

- polish prefs/full settings -> what about font size <-> tickr height ?

- editable feed title

- need sth really convenient to go to prev/next feed

- new clock delimiter setting

- marked items stuff -> FeedLinkAndOffset - highlight keywords ?

- wait for scrolling to complete before reloading feed (ie queue
  reloading)

- outline text

- new way of handling CLI args: "-revsc" = "-revsc=DEFAULT_VALUE"

- translations (finnish, french, german, spanish, russian, chinese,
  japanese, ?)

- split tickr_main.c (too big & a mess now) in 2 or more modules.

- what about: new expandable dynamic arrays in libetm ?
  -> mainly useful for array of 'big' elements

- move FList from tickr_list.c/h to libetm: dl_list.c/h (generic
  double-linked lists)

- what about: read all then show all -> -readallthenshowall=[y/n] ?

  is this a better alternative to feed delimiter setting ->
  make a new feed from all selected feeds (kind of new reading mode) ?

- no win32 drive letter in file:/// URL

- new -attop -attop+=n -atbottom -atbottom-=n CLI options

- -no-ui option should include preventing users to close the program

- new -conffile=FILE CLI option

- timeout to check network connectivity ?

- some caching mechanism ?

- ability to disable feed item tooltip

- add some plugin-able stuff

- hide tickr on mouseover (????) -> on <ctrl> + mouseover

- add 'feed organizer' after getting sample list

- update this:
  question at program start-up about new feed list format conversion:
  if version = 0.6.2 and feed list exists and feed list backup doesn't
  exist, create backup and convert to new format.

- could some arrays be replaced by linked lists (which eat much less
  memory ?)

- search/filter feature (option to filter out feed items on str,
  publication date, ...)

- add things to quicksetup: keyboard and mouse things, ?

- can gdk/cairo frame drawing be synced with vsync ?


(nothing decided yet)

- new option 'disable right-click' ???? not sure yet

- is it worth switching to gtk3 ?

- implement digest access authentication

- upload translation templates on launchpad

- improve file i/o code consistency

- 'detachable control win'

- handles to drag window

- pause scrolling for n seconds for each item -> -pauseeach=n

- sound alerts -> -allowsoundalerts=[y/n]

- read n times then exit -> -nread=n
