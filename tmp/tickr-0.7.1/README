1 - BUILDING TICKR FROM SOURCES

on Linux
--------

Required packages are GTK+2, Libxml2 and GNUTls (development ones.) Then do:

./configure
make
(sudo) make install
(make clean)


on Windows
----------

You will have to install MinGW and GTK development stuff (headers and
libs.) You will also need inno setup and reshacker (reshacker.exe must
be installed in /usr/local/ResHack/.)

If you want to use autotools, you will have to hack a little bit and
re-create your own Makefile.am and configure.ac. Those provided are ok
for ***Linux only*** at the moment.

So, instead of autotools, I use a script (build-on-win32) which works
fine for me on XP. You will have to adapt it to your build system, at
least replacing "manutm" by your user name (I'm working on improving
this script.)

You must also download gtk2-win32-runtime-bin.tar.gz (from
www.open-tickr.net), the GTK stack runtime which includes a patched
version of glib. (Of course, you may too get glib-2.26.0 sources, apply
the patch, compile it yourself then add it to the GTK runtime stack you
will have to build. Visit www.gtk.org for more info.)

Copy gtk-win32-full-runtime under tickr-<version_num> and run:
./build-on-win32
(it will build the win32 installer.)


2 - INSTALL DIRS DEFINED IN

- tickr.desktop
- debian/install
- debian/menu
- src/tickr/tickr.h
- src/tickr/Makefile.am


3 - APPLICATION NAME

source/binary package name and command

previous name:			news
last stable version:		0.5.2

new name:			tickr
first released version:		0.5.3

in src/tickr: all source files have now been renamed:
news_*.c/h -> tickr_*/c/h

app name and dirs are all (?) defined in tickr.h (at least they should be)
